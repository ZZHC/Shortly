Building Shortly
----------------

The source code of Shortly hosted on GitHub does not come with API keys for shortener services like goo.gl and bit.ly. If you want to build your own copy of Shortly, please follow the instructions:

  1. Please ensure you have Safari developer certification installed, and then import the `Shortly.safariextension/` folder into Extension Builder.
  2. Fill in your own API keys into `keychain.template.js`
  3. Rename `keychain.template.js` to `keychain.js`

Then you should be able to build a working copy of Shortly.
