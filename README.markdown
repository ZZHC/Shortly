Building your Shortly
---------------------

Shortly project has become open-souced since version 1.1.5, but the source hosted on github does not come with API keys for shortener services like goo.gl and bit.ly. You can take a look at keychain.template.js in the extension folder for instructions for setting API keys up. After setting up your API keys, your build of Shortly should be able to work.
